	<h1>Hello world! I'm Caley!</h1>
				<p>Welcome to my blog! If you’re here, you either know me or you’re lost. Luckily, if you’re lost, hitting the back button will correct your course. If you know me, hello friend!</p>
<p>This blog is a mixed bag. It has my leadership philosophy, shares my learning journey with a variety of technologies, and much more. If you want to learn more about me, <a href="/adventures-in-leading-and-writing/about">check out my bio</a>.</p>
