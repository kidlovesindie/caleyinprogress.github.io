### Stuff to do
- Add content to CV, etc.
- Figure out how you want your blog to look -- look up stuff on codepen, too
- Determine if SEO is a good thing to incorporate
- Come up with some blogs... Talk about the Python class? Talk about the Linux class? Talk about the journey to set this site up?
- Make an end of year post about being a manager and what you learned
- Figure out how you want to use this readme now that you have a project board for the repo
